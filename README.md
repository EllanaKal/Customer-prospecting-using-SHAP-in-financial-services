# Customer-prospecting-using-SHAP-in-financial-services

This project demonstrates how a financial institution can use machine learning and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to predict which customers are most likely to buy a new **digital financial product**, such as an online investment account.

---

## üß† Objective
To build a transparent and explainable model that helps marketing teams target high-potential customers based on data-driven insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Steps

1. **Data Generation / Loading**  
   Synthetic customer data is generated for demonstration:
   - Age  
   - Tenure  
   - Credit Score  
   - Average Balance  
   - Digital Engagement (# of logins per month)  
   - Previous Product Purchase  
   - Income  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Train an **XGBoost classifier** to predict purchase likelihood.
   - Evaluate with metrics like AUC, Accuracy, and Recall.

3. **Explainability with SHAP**  
   - Compute global and local SHAP values.
   - Visualize:
     - **SHAP Summary Plot** ‚Üí Key drivers of model predictions.
     - **Waterfall Plot** ‚Üí Individual customer-level explanations.

4. **Business Use**  
   - Identify top customer segments with high predicted probability.
   - Explain model decisions to marketing and compliance teams.
